**Feature Overview:**

**Email Template Structure:**

### 2. âœ… Improved Admin Session Management

**Problem Solved:**
- Previously, "Remember Me" kept admin logged in for 30 days regardless
- Without "Remember Me", sessions persisted until manual logout
- No distinction between session types

**New Behavior:**

#### Without "Remember Me" Checked:
- âœ“ Session expires when **browser tab is closed**
- âœ“ Requires login on next visit
- âœ“ More secure for shared computers
- âœ“ Session cookie lifetime = 0 (browser session)

#### With "Remember Me" Checked:
- âœ“ Session persists for **30 days**
- âœ“ Auto-login on subsequent visits
- âœ“ Secure cookie stored with HTTPOnly flag
- âœ“ Cookie refreshed on each page load
- âœ“ Session cookie lifetime = 30 days

#### Logout Behavior:
- âœ“ Always clears remember cookie
- âœ“ Destroys session completely
- âœ“ Requires password on next login regardless of previous setting

**Technical Implementation:**

```php
// Session configuration (all admin pages)
ini_set('session.cookie_lifetime', 0); // Default: browser session
ini_set('session.gc_maxlifetime', 86400); // 24h max on server

// Remember Me logic
if (isset($_COOKIE['admin_remember']) && $_COOKIE['admin_remember'] === 'true') {
    // Extend session to 30 days
    setcookie(session_name(), session_id(), time() + (30 * 24 * 60 * 60));
} else {
    // Keep as session cookie (expires on browser close)
    setcookie(session_name(), session_id(), 0);
}
```

**Session Flow:**

1. **Login without Remember Me:**
   - Session cookie created (lifetime = 0)
   - Admin logged in
   - Close browser â†’ Session ends
   - Next visit â†’ Must login again

2. **Login with Remember Me:**
   - Session cookie created (lifetime = 30 days)
   - Remember cookie created (lifetime = 30 days)
   - Close browser â†’ Session persists
   - Next visit â†’ Auto-login from cookie
   - Cookie auto-refreshes on each page load

3. **Logout:**
   - Remember cookie deleted
   - Session destroyed
   - All cookies cleared
   - Next visit â†’ Login required

**Files Modified:**
- `httpdocs/admin.php` - Main session logic and login form
- `httpdocs/backup.php` - Session handling
- `httpdocs/logs.php` - Session handling
- `httpdocs/tickets.php` - Session handling
- `httpdocs/update.php` - Session handling
- `httpdocs/users_admin.php` - Session handling

## Security Enhancements
