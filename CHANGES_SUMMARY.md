# EnderBit - Changes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Logging System Improvements

**Problem:** Debug messages like `[REGISTER] CASE 2: Sending verification email` and `[REGISTER] Settings - requireEmail: true` were being logged as errors in `php_errors.log`.

**Solution:**
- Removed all `error_log()` calls that were logging informational messages
- Replaced with appropriate `EnderBitLogger` methods:
  - `EnderBitLogger::logRegistration()` - User registration events
  - `EnderBitLogger::logEmail()` - Email sending events
  - `EnderBitLogger::logSystem()` - System/file operation events
  - `EnderBitLogger::logSecurity()` - Security-related events
- Added comprehensive logging to `verify.php` for email verification tracking
- All logs now go to their appropriate log files (registration.log, email.log, system.log, security.log)

**Files Modified:**
- `httpdocs/register.php`
- `httpdocs/verify.php`
- `httpdocs/config.php`
- `httpdocs/reply_ticket.php`
- `httpdocs/admin.php`

---

### 2. âœ… Background Scheduled Backups

**Problem:** Scheduled backups only ran when an admin was logged in and visited the backup page, requiring constant admin presence.

**Solution:**
- Created `httpdocs/cron_backup.php` - standalone script that runs independently
- Script checks schedule settings and performs backups without requiring admin login
- Removed automatic backup check from `backup.php` (admin page)
- Updated backup schedule save to show cron setup instructions

**Setup Instructions:**
```bash
# Add to crontab (runs every hour)
crontab -e

# Add this line:
0 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/httpdocs/cron_backup.php >> /path/to/httpdocs/backup_cron.log 2>&1
```

**Files Modified:**
- `httpdocs/backup.php` - Removed session-dependent backup check
- `httpdocs/cron_backup.php` - **NEW FILE** - Background backup script
- `README.md` - Added cron setup instructions

---

### 3. âœ… Admin Session Persistence ("Remember Me")

**Problem:** Admin users were being prompted to log in again after some time, even if they hadn't explicitly logged out.

**Solution:**
- Added "Remember Me" checkbox to admin login form
- Sets secure, HTTP-only cookie valid for 30 days when checked
- Auto-login feature: if cookie exists, admin is automatically logged back in
- Cookie is properly cleared on explicit logout
- Session extends automatically while cookie is valid

**How it works:**
1. Admin logs in and checks "Remember me for 30 days"
2. Secure cookie is set in browser
3. On subsequent visits, cookie automatically logs admin in
4. Only cleared when user clicks "Logout" button

**Files Modified:**
- `httpdocs/admin.php` - Added cookie logic and UI checkbox

---

### 4. âœ… Larger Admin Login Form

**Problem:** Admin login page felt cramped with a tiny rectangle (420px max-width).

**Solution:**
- Increased max-width from 420px to 550px
- Added padding: 48px vertical, 40px horizontal (was 24px all around)
- Added padding to login-wrapper for better spacing on small screens
- Enhanced visual appearance with emoji and better spacing

**Changes:**
- Login card: 420px â†’ 550px width
- Padding: 24px â†’ 48px (top/bottom) and 40px (left/right)
- Added emoji to title and button for better visual appeal
- Better spacing between form elements

**Files Modified:**
- `httpdocs/admin.php` - CSS and HTML updates

---

### 5. âœ… Unified Dashboard Stats Container

**Problem:** Dashboard statistics looked like clickable buttons with hover effects, causing confusion.

**Solution:**
- Combined all 4 stat cards into one unified container
- Created single large rectangle with internal divisions
- Stats displayed side-by-side in 4 columns with subtle borders
- Removed hover effects and transform animations
- Cleaner, more professional information display

**Visual Changes:**
- Before: 4 separate hoverable cards with shadows and transforms
- After: Single unified container with 4 stat columns
- Responsive: Stacks vertically on mobile with horizontal dividers
- No more button-like appearance

**Files Modified:**
- `httpdocs/admin.php` - CSS restructure and HTML changes

---

## Additional Improvements

### Enhanced Logging Events
Added logging for these events:
- Email verification attempts (successful/failed)
- User creation after email verification
- Invalid verification tokens (security log)
- Token file write failures
- Admin approval workflows

### Better Error Messages
More descriptive system logs help diagnose issues:
- Separate logs for different failure types
- Context-rich log entries with email, username, actions
- Security events properly categorized by severity
