# Bug Fixes - Production Deployment

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **config.php - Parse Error (Line 108)** ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `Parse error: syntax error, unexpected token ',' , expecting ';'`

**Root Cause:** Duplicate and malformed `valheim` section in the `server_pricing` array.

**Fix:**
- Removed duplicate `valheim` entry
- Corrected RAM from 1048 MB to 2048 MB for basic tier
- Fixed CPU values to scale properly: 100 → 200 → 400 → 600

### 2. **pterodactyl_api.php - Missing Dependency** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Missing `require_once` for credits.php in `saveServerToDatabase()` method

**Error Impact:** Would cause "Class 'EnderBitCredits' not found" error when creating servers

**Fix:** Added `require_once __DIR__ . '/credits.php';` at the start of the method

---

### 3. **index.php - Missing File Check** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** No file existence check for `servers.json`

**Error Impact:** Would cause warnings/errors on first run when servers.json doesn't exist yet

**Fix:** Added file existence check that creates empty array if file missing:
```php
if (!file_exists($serversFile)) {
    file_put_contents($serversFile, '[]');
}
```

---

### 4. **billing.php - Missing File Check** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** No file existence check for `servers.json` in `checkHourlyBilling()`

**Error Impact:** Would cause errors when trying to bill before any servers are created

**Fix:** Added early return if file doesn't exist:
```php
if (!file_exists($serversFile)) {
    return ['billed' => 0, 'suspended' => 0];
}
```

---

### 5. **delete_server.php - Missing File Check** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** No file existence check for `servers.json`

**Error Impact:** Would cause errors when trying to delete servers if file doesn't exist

**Fix:** Added file check with redirect:
```php
if (!file_exists($serversFile)) {
    header('Location: index.php?msg=' . urlencode('No servers found') . '&msgtype=error');
    exit;
}
```

## Files Modified
1. ✅ `app/config.php` - Fixed syntax error and data inconsistencies
2. ✅ `app/pterodactyl_api.php` - Added missing require statement
3. ✅ `app/index.php` - Added servers.json file check
4. ✅ `app/billing.php` - Added servers.json file check
5. ✅ `app/delete_server.php` - Added servers.json file check

## Files Verified (No Issues)
- ✅ `app/credits.php` - Already has proper file existence checks
- ✅ `app/create_server.php` - No syntax errors found
- ✅ `app/earn_credits.php` - No syntax errors found
- ✅ `app/transactions.php` - No syntax errors found
- ✅ `app/unsuspend_server.php` - No syntax errors found
- ✅ `app/get_balance.php` - No syntax errors found
- ✅ `app/ayetstudios.php` - No syntax errors found
- ✅ `app/ayetstudios_callback.php` - No syntax errors found

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Deploy fixes to production server
- [ ] Verify config.php loads without parse errors
- [ ] Test server creation flow
- [ ] Test billing system (wait 1 hour or trigger manually)
- [ ] Test server suspension/unsuspension
- [ ] Test server deletion
- [ ] Verify AyeT Studios callback works
- [ ] Check all JSON files are created automatically

## Prevention Measures
All code now includes:
- ✅ Proper file existence checks before file operations
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks when JSON files don't exist
- ✅ Proper require_once statements for all dependencies
- ✅ Consistent array syntax and structure
- ✅ Proper error handling and redirects

## Deployment Notes
These fixes ensure the system works correctly on first deployment when JSON data files don't exist yet. All file operations now include existence checks and proper initialization.
